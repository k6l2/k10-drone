-Create a simple breadboard circuit connecting Arduino Uno + sparkfun bluesmirf silver + GY-87
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] communication & programming of the bluesmirf
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] read GY-87 output and print the output to Serial & bluetooth just to see if it's working
-[PC APPLICATION] SDL2 window
-[PC APPLICATION] OpenGL 4.6 context
-[PC APPLICATION] ImGUI
-[PC APPLICATION] connect to bluetooth device and facilitate serial I/O
-[PC APPLICATION] read GY-87 data from the drone and display using GUI
-[PC APPLICATION] move bluetooth device inquiry to a separate thread
-[PC APPLICATION] move bluetooth socket I/O to a separate thread
-[PC APPLICATION] create origin mesh
-[PC APPLICATION] draw 3D model of the drone
-[PC APPLICATION] orbit camera around the origin, control w/ mouse (click+drag)
-[PC APPLICATION] test remote programming of the bluesmirf
--------------------------- DONE ----------------------------------------------
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] pack the GY-87 data into binary instead of ASCII text
-[PC APPLICATION] decode binary telemetry
-[PC APPLICATION] set the 3D model of the drone to the interpreted orientation based on telemetry
