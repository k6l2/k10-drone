-Create a simple breadboard circuit connecting Arduino Uno + sparkfun bluesmirf silver + GY-87
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] communication & programming of the bluesmirf
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] read GY-87 output and print the output to Serial & bluetooth just to see if it's working
-[PC APPLICATION] SDL2 window
-[PC APPLICATION] OpenGL 4.6 context
-[PC APPLICATION] ImGUI
-[PC APPLICATION] connect to bluetooth device and facilitate serial I/O
-[PC APPLICATION] read GY-87 data from the drone and display using GUI
-[PC APPLICATION] move bluetooth device inquiry to a separate thread
-[PC APPLICATION] move bluetooth socket I/O to a separate thread
-[PC APPLICATION] create origin mesh
-[PC APPLICATION] draw 3D model of the drone
-[PC APPLICATION] orbit camera around the origin, control w/ mouse (click+drag)
-[PC APPLICATION] test remote programming of the bluesmirf
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] pack the GY-87 data into binary instead of ASCII text
-[PC APPLICATION] decode binary telemetry
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] implement some kind of Absolute Orientation Sensor using raw IMU output
	sensor fusion info: https://www.w3.org/TR/motion-sensors/
-[PC APPLICATION] set the 3D model of the drone to the interpreted orientation based on telemetry
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] improve calculation of 'relativeOrientationRadians' because right now this method kinda sucks
	-holy shit... are the value of 'degreesPerSecond' ACTUALLY in radiansPerSecond???...
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] calibrate accelerometer during setup
-purchase necessary drone parts for the next phase of development
	-jumper wire headers for my old radio's Rx module

	-28-pin dip socket for the atmega
		[$1] https://www.sparkfun.com/products/7942
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] apply a median filter to the accelerometer (maybe like ~10-15ish frames long?)
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] calculate roll/pitch based on accelerometer using equation 25/26 in the AN3461.pdf document
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] apply a complementary filter on the filtered gyro+accelerometer data (~99.5% gyro | ~0.5% accelerometer to start)
--------------------------- DONE ----------------------------------------------
-[ARDUINO FLIGHT CONTROLLER] God the AN3461 document is such a shitty resource.. these results are terrible!
	-Maybe use this paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6111698/
